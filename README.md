# Pyramid

A version of my Slope([C](https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/slope))([C++](https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/slopeCPP)) program which is a simple command line program that displays an ASCII pyramid.

# Building

`cmake . && make`


# Usage

Follow the instructions that appear when running the program, I guess.
